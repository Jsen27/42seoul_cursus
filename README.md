This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during my time at 42 Seoul Cursus. Each folder represents a different project, with information and source code included.

## Project List

1. [libft](./libft) - Implementation of a C library with various functions.
2. [get_next_line](./get_next_line) - Implementation of a function to read lines from a file descriptor.
3. [ft_printf](./ft_printf) - Simplified version of the printf function.
4. [Born2beroot] - Build servers on virtual machines (No code)
5. [minitalk](./minitalk) - Implementing a basic client-server communication program using signals.
6. [push_swap](./push_swap) - Sorting algorithm visualizer and optimizer.
7. [so_long](./so_long) - 2D game development using the Minilibx library.
8. [philosophers](./Philosophers) - Solving the dining philosophers problem.
9. [minishell](./minishell) - Implementation of a basic Unix shell. (2 people project)
10. [netPractice] - Focusing on networking practice and gaining hands-on experience with networking concepts and protocols.
11. [cpp_module_00~09](./cpp_module) - Developing C++ modules to enhance programming skills in C++ programming.
12. [cub3d](./cub3d) - Simple 3D game engine using raycasting techniques. (2 people project)
13. [ft_irc](./ft_irc) - Implementing an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, focusing on network communication and protocol implementation. (3 people project)
14. [inception](./inception) - Broaden your knowledge of system dministration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine
15. [ft_transcendence](./ft_transcendence) - This project is an ongoing project. Detailed information and status updates for this project are pending. As of now, it is actively being worked on.
